Masjid al-Aqsa is the mosque that holds significance for most of the prophets sent to Earth by Allah. the first time it was built by Hazrat Adam (AS) as a place of worship. Some people hold the opinion that it was first built by Hazrat Ibrahim (AS). Bayt-ul-Maqdis was rebuilt and renovated many times.
Masjid al-Aqsa was a place of worship even during the times Hazrat Ibrahim’s sons Hazrat Ismail (AS) and Hazrat Ishaaq (AS). His grandson Hazrat Yaqub (AS) and his son Hazrat Yusuf (AS) also witnessed the glory of Masjid al-Aqsa as a reverent place of worship.

Hazrat Dawood (AS) conquered Palestine and ruled over Jerusalem. Masjid al-Aqsa was reconstructed by his son Prophet Suleiman (AS).

The reverence of Bayt-ul-Maqdis was such that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) used to talk about the mosque quite often to his companions. Hundreds of Allah’s prophets and messengers are buried at this place. Even many of companions are laid to rest here.</p>

<p style="color:green;background-color:pink;">Muftis’ reaction to tragic incident

Reacting to the tragic incident that took place in Masjid-e-Nabawi, Mufti Taqi Usmani, a well-known Pakistani cleric, religious scholar, and superintendent of Darul Uloom Karachi, said, “The Companions also kept their voices low on the Holy Shrine of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) so as not to be rude, but the mentally ill today proved that for them literature, respect, sanctity, and morality are mere myths.”

Chairman Pakistan Ulema Council Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi has said on the incident of Masjid-e-Nabawi that there is a state of grief that is not going away. The government should take strict action against those who have incited this violence inside Pakistan.

He said the Saudi government would and would take action against those who violated its rules, but could not tolerate anything but respect for the two holy shrines. This was not a small thing, Pakistan was discredited and the sanctity of the Holy Shrine was violated.

He said that an important announcement would be made on April 30 in this regard. Maulana Tariq Jameel has issued a statement on Twitter regarding the incident that took place in Masjid-e-Nabawi that the violation of Haram Sharif in the case of protest in Masjid-e-Nabawi is not correct in Islam at all, it should be condemned as much as possible.

What will be the future of the responsible ones?

The Saudi government has arrested dozens of PTI supporters for violating the sanctity of the Prophet (PBUH)’s Mosque. It has also been decided to give severe punishments to the accused Sahibzada Jahangir, who was the mastermind of the incident that took place in Medina last evening.

Media sources said that Sahibzada Jahangir, a friend of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, and about 150 people have been arrested for violating the sanctity of the Prophet’s Mosque. Penalties and lifelong Hajj and Umrah are banned.

After a detailed investigation, those who tampered with the slogans or insulted the sanctity of the Prophet PBUH’s Mosque are expected to be flogged and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Experts say that in the wake of this incident, it is to be hoped that the visa policy for Umrah or Hajj for Pakistanis will be changed and the conditions may be tightened, which will make it more difficult for Pakistanis to travel to Saudi Arabia.</p>
